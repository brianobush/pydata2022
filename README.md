Practical MLOps: Do we need all the things?

# Abstract

MLOps is a straightforward yet enveloping concept. Implementing MLOps standard practices can be challenging in small groups or companies. 
What are the bare minimum MLOps pieces you need to reap the benefits of MLOps and show ROI in your ML endeavors? 
We discuss a practical approach to building MLOps in small groups with a focused example.

# Description

MLOps is slowly evolving into the common approach to ML lifecycle management. The core problem
addressed is how data science groups can move their models into production robustly.
Building out an MLOps system involves reproducible pipelines, monitoring, versioning models, 
data versioning, and more. Do we need all of those things?
Typical MLOps best practices are often discussed in the context of large corporations, trillions of requests,
and petabytes of data. Most organizations are not at this scale yet can benefit from MLOps.
We discuss using a subset of MLOps with a real-world example addressed with Kedro, an unopinionated open source MLOps platform.
